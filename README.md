# CR10 V2 Stuff

I'd had enough of the bowden extruder on my CR10 v2... so much so that the alternative was a complete overhaul and upgrade of my whole printer in the form of an E3D Hemera. Here are all the parts, hardware lists and firmware setup for upgrading a CR10 v2 to a direct drive extruder and Klipper/Moonraker/Mainsail setup 🤘

## 📦 Hardware

I purchased most of my upgrade hardware from the awesome chaps at 3DJake. Feel free to do the same or do some hunting around yourself. The Creality specific BLTouch cable was definitely worthwhile getting. Yes it's a little more expensive, but for a plug and play, it was worth it.

- Creality CR10 V2 (obviously)
- Big Tree Tech SKR Mini E3 V2.0
- E3D Hemera
- BLTouch
- Magnetic Bed and PEI Sheet
